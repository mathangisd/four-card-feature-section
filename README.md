## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use auto-fit keyword and minmax function to make the design more responsive without using media query. Also I specified grid area using grid-lines to make it match with the given desktop design. I also used the ::after pseduo-element to draw the top border and set the overflow to hidden to get the specific border shape in the design.

### Continued-Development
I would like to work on projects with different layouts and focus on making them responsive.
